      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Since its founding in the 1970s, the Computing Science Student Society has existed to
        promote the interests of students within the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser
        University. The Society strives to support and build a vibrant community of individuals and
        create an environment that produces social, academic, and professional success. The CSSS
        continues this tradition today by running numerous social events throughout the school year,
        as well as hosting workshops, talks by industry speakers, and development contests for
        budding programmers.
