    <p>
      Since its founding in the 1970s, the Computing Science Student Society has existed to promote
      the interests of students within the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University.
      The Society strives to support and build a vibrant community of individuals and create an
      environment that produces social, academic, and professional success. The CSSS continues this
      tradition today by running numerous social events throughout the school year, as well as
      hosting workshops, talks by industry speakers, and development contests for budding
      programmers.

    <p>
      Located next to the Computing Science Instructional Lab (CSIL) in the Applied Sciences
      Building (ASB) in room ASB9971, the Common Room serves as a place for CS students to relax,
      study, and socialize. Inside, you will also find a Coke machine serving the cheapest pop on
      campus, couches, a fridge, and a free-to-use computer terminal. There's even an exam bank of
      past tests for most courses. Just ask someone at the back of the room to direct you towards an
      officer who can show you. If you want to get involved with the CSSS, this is the best place to
      start.
