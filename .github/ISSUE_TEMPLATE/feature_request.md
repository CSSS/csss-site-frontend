## Motivation behind the feature and what it will do
Explain what problem this is trying to fix or why it should become a part of the site. (e.g. I think it would be cool to have a study group organizer on the site that is integrated with a bot on Discord)

## Which part of the application will this feature be for?
The component library (CSSS code), a new web page for CSSS, or a new application runnable on the site? (e.g. a new application running on the site)

## Minimal Viable Product
List of what subfeatures will be in place. Does not require it to be polished, just list the features you think makes this usable.
- [ ] e.g. Allows users to create a study group

## Code changes
Will this require a large change in the existing code base or will this just be a new module with minimal changes.

## Support needed
If you're not sure how to implement it or you're not a programmer, let us know! Sometimes great ideas come from people that don't know how to code. Maybe we could assign a contributor to help execute your vision or maybe you want to learn and someone could guide you through the process. 

##Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. Figma, Paint, Photoshop, show us what the application will look like on the site!
