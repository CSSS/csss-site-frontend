## Motivation behind the feature and what it will do
Explain what problem this is trying to fix or why it should become a part of the site. (e.g. I think it would be cool to have a study group organizer on the site that is integrated with a bot on Discord)

## Which part of the application will this feature be for?
The component library (CSSS code), a new web page for CSSS, or a new application runnable on the site? (e.g. a new application running on the site)

## Minimal Viable Product
List of what subfeatures will be in place
- [ ] e.g. Allows users to create a study group

## Code changes
Will this require a large change in the existing code base or will this just be a new module with minimal changes.
