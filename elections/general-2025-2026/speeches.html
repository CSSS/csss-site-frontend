                        <p>Hi everyone!</p>
                        <div>Over the last 3 years, the CSSS has become my second home, and I've made many friends and met many amazing, passionate people. During my time here, I served a number of positions. First as a volunteer, then as Exec-at-Large, then as Council Rep, and now as Treasurer. I hope my experience in each of these roles have created a strong foundation in understanding how our student society functions, and how we connect with the faculty, the SFSS, clubs, professors, and the student body.</div>
                        <div><br>
                        </div>
                        <div>In my past roles, I have been responsible for helping in various logistics in multiple iterations of our large events: Frosh Week, Tech Fair, Fall Hacks, Mountain Madness, FAS Formal, the Silicon Valley Trip, and many other events as well.</div>
                        <div><br>
                        </div>
                        <div>This year, I have been predominantly responsible for financial oversight in nearly every aspect of the CSSS. From our large-scale events to each and every board games night, I have been balancing the budget and working on funding to help bring as many events as possible to you. In addition to that, I have been involved on a number of other projects over the last few months, including the common room move, the workshops on microcontrollers, and our summer touch grass hike and dessert crawl.</div>
                        <div><br>
                        </div>
                        <div>During my presidency, I intend to oversee the following:</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing relations with professors, staff, and the faculty as a whole</li>
                            <li>Strengthening the community through our events through collaborations with other clubs and student societies</li>
                            <li>Expanding external company and alumni contact networks towards improving educational and career-oriented opportunities</li>
                            <li>Upgrading the common room space for bettering campus life and connecting with students individually</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>A lot of time and effort is required to run the society, but this community is important to me, and I wish to have a hand in continuing to improve the SFU experience for CS students. As your president, I hope be your voice for the upcoming year.</div>
                        <p>Thank you,<br>Mabel Ling</p>

I plan to advocate for <span style="font-weight:700;">smaller and diverse</span>&nbsp;events, and to <span style="font-weight:700;">collaborate with other DSUs and clubs</span>&nbsp;to bring a greater variety and inclusivity to our club.</div>

Since arriving, I’ve been involved with the events committee, helping to plan and organize activities. One of my proudest contributions was hosting a CS transfer/international info session and panel, where I shared my experiences as an international transfer student and invited fellow transfer students to discuss theirs.</p>

                        <p>If elected, I’d love to continue the fantastic events that the CSSS already offers. I also plan to introduce more active, sports-oriented gatherings, because what better way to bond and stay healthy than getting out and being active together?</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, AI is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, and it’s not about replacing us—it’s about empowering us. I want to organize workshops and demonstrations on how to use AI tools effectively, maximizing both our learning and efficiency. It’s time to move beyond fear and embrace the potential AI brings.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I believe there’s a world of opportunity beyond the usual “FAANG” dream. I want to invite inspiring professionals who come from similar backgrounds and have made a positive impact on our communities, so they can share their journeys and show us how fulfilling it is to serve society in diverse, meaningful ways.</p>

                        <p>I’d be honored to have your support. Let’s keep growing, learning, and building a community that thrives together. Thank you.</p>

                        <p>Hi,</p>

                        <p>
                            My name is Meyer Kaur Sarna, and I am currently in my third year of the Software Systems program at SFU.
                            I am excited to nominate myself for the position of Director of Events for the upcoming year. Over the
                            past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to witness how CSSS events bring our community together,
                            creating a space where students can connect, collaborate, and grow. I am eager to take on the responsibility
                            of planning, organizing, and executing large-scale CSSS-sponsored events that not only foster a sense of belonging
                            but also provide valuable networking and learning experiences.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            With my background in software systems and experience managing multiple projects efficiently, I am confident in my
                            ability to lead the Events Committee, delegate tasks effectively, and ensure the seamless execution of events that
                            reflect the interests and diversity of our community. I am committed to introducing innovative event formats that
                            engage both new and returning members, making sure that every CSSS event leaves a lasting impact. If provided the
                            opportunity, I will work tirelessly to create events that bring our community together and strengthen our connections
                            within and beyond SFU. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to contributing to the CSSS in a meaningful way.</p>

And let’s be real: if AI can write essays, pass exams, and even flirt better than some of us (<i>looking at you, ChatGPT</i>), then surely, <i>together</i>, we can make CSSS events legendary.</div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><b>My Mission? Events So Good, You’ll Skip Lecture (Just Kidding… Unless?)<br>
                        </b>Great events aren’t just about free pizza (though, let’s be real, pizza <i>is</i>&nbsp;a powerful motivator). I want every CSSS gathering to be <b>unmissable</b>—whether it’s leveling up your skills, making career connections, or just vibing with your people. And if we can recruit AI as our hype-man, DJ, or even event-planning sidekick? <b>Error 404: Boring Not Found.</b></div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><b>Here’s the Blueprint (No GitHub Forking Required):</b></div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;">⚡ <b>Hackathons That Actually Hack Your Excitement</b><br>
                        Bigger prizes. Cooler tech. More <b>"Wait, how did they build that in 12 hours?!"</b>&nbsp;moments. Plus, introducing: <b>AI vs. Human Debugging Battles</b>—because nothing bonds people like collectively roasting a stubborn algorithm. <i>(Disclaimer: If the AI wins, we’ll say it cheated.)</i></div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;">🎮 <b>Game Nights: Where “Touch Grass” is Optional</b><br>
                        From <b>Minecraft LAN parties</b>&nbsp;to <b>"Guess the Error" trivia</b>, we’ll make sure there’s something for everyone—even if your idea of "outdoorsy" is taking your laptop to the park. <i>Bonus: If an NPC starts flirting with you, that’s just the AI testing its social skills.</i></div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;">🤖 <b>Networking That Doesn’t Feel Like a LinkedIn Simulator</b><br>
                        Casual meetups with industry pros, <b>"Tech Confessions" panels</b>&nbsp;(ever debugged for 6 hours only to realize you missed a semicolon? <i>Same.</i>), and maybe even a <b>speed-friending event</b>—because your next co-founder, bestie, or meme-sharing buddy is out there.</div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;">🍕 <b>Workshops That Won’t Put You to Sleep</b><br>
                        Hands-on sessions with experts in AI, cybersecurity, and more—<b>minus the lecture-hall existential dread</b>. <i>Demo crashes? Free pizza + emotional support from a room full of people who’ve also cried over Python.</i></div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;"><b>Why Me?</b></div>
                        <div style="margin: 0px 0px 8pt;">As <b>VP of Events at SFSS</b>, I’ve organized everything from cultural festivals to <b>"De-stress with Dogs"</b>&nbsp;days (yes, puppies &gt; Python). I know what makes an event <b>fun vs. forgettable</b>, and I’ll always prioritize <i>your</i>&nbsp;ideas—because the best events come from <i>you</i>.</div>

                        <p>
                            I am Meyer Kaur Sarna, a third-year software systems student at SFU, and I am excited to
                            nominate myself for the position of Assistant Director of Events. CSSS events have always
                            played a crucial role in bringing students together and fostering a sense of community.
                            As someone who is passionate about event management and community engagement, I am eager
                            to contribute by planning, organizing, and executing recurring CSSS-sponsored events that
                            keep our community connected and thriving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this role, I am ready to support the Director of Events by ensuring that each event runs
                            smoothly and meets the high standards that our members expect. I will bring my strong
                            organizational skills, attention to detail, and commitment to teamwork to the Events Committee,
                            ensuring that our events remain both engaging and well-coordinated. I am enthusiastic about the
                            opportunity to help enhance the student experience through recurring events that are not only
                            fun but also foster connections and collaboration within the CSSS community.

I am frequently in the common room, board game night, and photographing hackathons. If you look in the common room white boards, there is usually a drawing I made that is threatened with the eraser for when someone actually needs to use the whiteboards. For the last six years I have done graphic design as an editor and creative director where I became proficient in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and Lightroom. I have experience in digital publishing, yearbook design, and aviation photography. On the side, I like to do a little bit of graphic design for fun that challenges my abilities with more complex tools and designs.&nbsp;</div>

                        <p><span >Hi :D My name is Amelia Shen, and I am a first-year student in the SFU-ZJU Dual Degree Program for Computing Science and Finance. Not sure if anyone knows who I am, but all you need to know is that I can draw and design with tools like Canva, Figma, Procreate, and Affinity Design 😎.</span></p>
                        <p><span >I have experience creating media for clubs as I was the Marketing Director for three clubs in high school: a science demo club, the student press club, and the business club. I would manage the Instagram accounts by uploading designed posts for events, writing captions, and posting stories. As the Marketing Director of the science demo club, I would also use my phone and a professional camera to film and take pictures for the Instagram posts. For the student press club, I would work with editors and authors to make aesthetic posts that introduced short stories, editorials, articles, etc. For the business club, I made posts for events like case competitions and infographics on starting small businesses, the stock market, etc.</span></p>
                        <p><span >In the past, I had a lot of fun making designed posts for these clubs. My position as Marketing Director allowed me to take a break from schoolwork and spend time drawing and designing media. There was always a new theme, and I never got bored. I miss fulfilling this role, and I do not want to spend my weeks wasting away coding, so I wanted to apply for this position for CSSS. I have seen the CSSS Instagram, and I believe I can add my unique style and creativity. I already have a vision in mind. If I were elected, the Instagram account would be swag and awesome. Drawing has been a favourite hobby of mine since middle school, so you can trust I have years of experience 🫡. I also went to the gingerbread-making event and had a good time with friends :D.</span></p>
