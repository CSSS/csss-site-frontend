                        <p style="font-weight:700;">Hello all!</p>
                        <p>My name is Matthew, and I’m a 3rd year Computing Science student running for <span style="font-weight:700;">Treasurer</span>&nbsp;of the CSSS for 2025-2025!</p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve been an active member of the CS community, contributing to student clubs like <span style="font-weight:700;">SFU Robot Soccer</span>
                            and <span style="font-weight:700;">SFU SubVision</span>, where I’ve worked on designing and building software in team-based engineering
                            environments. I’ve also regularly attended CSSS events like Board Games Nights, Hackathons, and FROSH,
                            so I understand firsthand how important it is for funding to flow back into our student community in fun, engaging, and meaningful ways.
                        </p>
                        <p>Outside of academics, I stay involved in my local community by helping to clean and decorate our space for events and
                            gatherings. I’ve found this to be a great way to give back and support the people around me. It’s taught me the value
                            of pitching in behind the scenes to help make things run smoothly - something I’d bring to the Treasurer role as well.</p>
                        <p>
                            As Treasurer, I want to make sure our <span style="font-weight:700;">student fees are put to good
                            use</span>&nbsp;by supporting events, initiatives, and resources that create opportunities for everyone in our community.
                            Having attended CSSS General Meetings, I have learned about the importance of communication between execs, performing cash
                            motions for events, and the administrative work that goes on to keep the CSSS running. Furthermore, I believe in financial
                            transparency and smart budgeting. I’ll work with the exec team to make sure every dollar we spend makes a meaningful impact
                            for the CS community here.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are some of my <span style="font-weight:700;">goals for the upcoming term</span>:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

                            </div></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I love the CSSS and the energy that our community brings to SFU. If elected, I’ll do my best to help keep things
                            running smoothly behind the scenes so you can focus on learning, making friends, and having fun.

                            Hello everyone, my name is Parsa, and I transferred to SFU in the Summer of 2024. Since arriving,
                            I’ve been involved with the events committee, helping to plan and organize activities. One of my
                            proudest contributions was <u>hosting a CS transfer/international info session and panel</u>, where I
                            shared my experiences as an international transfer student and invited fellow transfer students
                            to discuss theirs.

                        <p>
                            If elected, I’d love to help out with the fantastic events that the CSSS already offers. I also
                            would like to introduce more active, sports-oriented gatherings, because what better way to bond
                            and stay healthy than getting out and being active together?

                            Hello to all and everyone😊!! My name is Barsin, I’m a second-year CS student and am extremely excited
                            to be running for Assistant Director of Events(ADOE)!! I’m running for this role not just to give back
                            to the CS community that has given me so much, but also be one of the reasons to help it grow stronger,
                            more connected and a lot more fun!! I have a passion for having fun (who doesn’t?! DUH) and been involved
                            with running clubs and organizing many events since I was 15 which has really shaped my skills in planning,
                            healthy communication and organizing events. I genuinely love bringing people together — and what better way
                            than with game nights, pizza, and good vibes every other week?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also believe that a strong, friendly community would lead to a higher rate of achievement and success among
                            students — not just during academic years but also after. Therefore, my main goal for next year is to help create
                            engaging, inclusive, and exciting events that help us look at each other as teammates, not just a classmates or
                            competitors =))
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thank you for reading — and if you're looking for someone who brings energy, ideas, and a deep love for snacks and
                            scheduling, then I’d be honoured to have your vote as ADOE! ❤️
