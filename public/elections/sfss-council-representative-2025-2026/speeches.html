                        <div style="text-align:left;text-indent:0;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">Dear CSSS Members,</div>
                        <div style="text-align:left;text-indent:0;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">My name is <b>Chitransh Motwani</b>, and I am excited to run for your <b>2025-2026 CSSS Council Representative</b>.

                        <div style="text-align:left;text-indent:0;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;">I currently serve as the <b>Vice President of Events &amp; Student Affairs at the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS)</b>, where I represent over 26,000 students and oversee event planning, budgeting, and community engagement. In this role, I have successfully:</div>

                        <div style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;"><b>Secure More Funding for CSSS Events &amp; Initiatives</b>&nbsp;– I know exactly how SFSS Council evaluates funding requests, and I will use this knowledge to ensure CSSS gets the grants it needs.</div></li><li >

                        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
                        
                        <p>My name is Matthew Wong, and I’m currently the President of SFU Surge, SFU’s leading tech club focused on empowering students through innovation, learning, and community. Over the past three years, I’ve had the opportunity to lead and organize some of the university’s most impactful student-run events, including JourneyHacks, our beginner-friendly hackathon; StormHacks, a 500 person annual hackathon that brings together students across Canada; and the Surge Projects Program, where we help students go from idea to deployment in cross-functional teams.</p>

                        <p>These experiences weren’t just about running events, they were about building trust with students, collaborating across faculties, and navigating the realities of what it means to represent people. I’ve worked closely with SFSS Council before to secure funding, propose changes to event policy, and advocate for better support for student-led initiatives. I know how important it is for Council to be a space where student voices aren’t just heard, but turned into action. If elected as your CSSS Council Representative, I’ll bring the same level of commitment, transparency, and initiative I’ve brought to Surge. I’ll represent our community with integrity, push for more opportunities for student growth, and ensure that our concerns as computing science students are reflected in decisions at the highest level.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your time, and I’d be honoured to earn your vote.</p>

                        <p>Hey everyone! My name is Surya Murali, and I’m running to be your next <b>CSSS Council Representative</b>.</p>
                        <p>Over the past year, I’ve been lucky to be a part of the CSSS Community — especially during <b>CSSS Frosh 2024</b>, where I helped across almost every event. Frosh was a <b>huge success</b>, and that’s thanks to the incredible work of our execs. I saw firsthand how much they put on the line — their time, effort, and passion — all for the sake of building something amazing for our community.</p>
                        <p>But I also saw the <b>frustrations behind the scenes </b>— slow processes, budget disputes, and back-and-forths with SFSS. I want to step in and make sure that kind of stress doesn’t get in the way of the things that make CSSS great.</p>
                        <p><b>First</b>, I’ll be a <b>strong voice during SFSS Council meetings</b>— because that’s where the real decisions happen. It’s not about where funds are “allocated” on paper — it’s about how councillors vote when CSSS asks for support. I’ve done my homework, gone through SFSS financials, and I know how to advocate clearly and effectively. If elected, I’ll be that person who gets others on board — so <b>CSSS events get the votes they need</b>.</span></p>
                        <p><b>Second</b>, I’ll work to build <b>stronger connections with other DSUs across SFU</b>. CSSS is one of the most active student societies on campus — we should be leading the charge in bringing students together. I want us to collaborate more with other departments, host cross-faculty events, and make CSSS the hub for innovation and community at SFU.</span></h2>
                        <p><b>Finally, I’m running on transparency and presence</b>. That means keeping you updated on what’s happening in Council, being available for feedback, and spending more time in the common room to connect with everyone — not just during campaign season, but throughout the year. I know that sometimes it can feel hard to speak up or be heard, and I want to make sure no one feels left out of the loop.</span></p>
                        <p>I’ve been on the ground, I’ve done the research, and I care deeply about making sure CSSS continues to grow without being held back by bureaucracy. If you want a rep who’s experienced, approachable, and ready to advocate — I’d be honoured to have your vote.</p>
                        <p>Let’s make it happen — together. Thank you!</p>
