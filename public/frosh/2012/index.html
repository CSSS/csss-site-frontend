      <h1>What is FroshWeek?</h1>

      <p>
        FroshWeek is the ultimate introductory experience for Computing Science students at Simon
        Fraser University. Organized by the Computing Science Student Society, in partnership with
        the School of Computing Science, it is a week of fun-filled activities designed to orient,
        entertain and educate new university students with a Computing Science twist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Held during the first week of the Fall semester at SFU (Sept. 4 - 8), FroshWeek is organized
        by students, for students. Incoming students receive: an in-depth introduction to the
        facilities available to them as Computing Science students; many entertaining on- and
        off-campus challenges and diversions to motivate, amuse, and connect them with other
        students; valuable advice from their elders with respect to courses and the university
        experience in general; and some free food and tools to make the transition to university
        much smoother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now in its ninth year, Computing Science's Froshweek has matured into one of the most well
        received and recognized student-organized events at Simon Fraser University. It is a
        memorable and cherished week for participants and organizers alike.
      </p>

      <h1>What is the Computing Science Student Society?</h1>

      <p>
        The Computing Science Student Society is a departmental student society based out of Simon
        Fraser University. Operating under the Simon Fraser Student Society, we act to recognize the
        academic and recreational demands of Computing Science students, providing them with a
        better experience at SFU. We have seats on the School of Computing Science Undergraduate
        Program Committee and the Faculty of Applied Science Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. The
        society also facilitates recreational activities, such as LAN parties, board game nights and
        movie nights, as well as joining the Simon Fraser Student Society and other departmental
        student societies for events. On a day-to-day level, the society provides services for
        Computing Science students such as a common area, printing, and inexpensive beverages.
