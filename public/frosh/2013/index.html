        <h1>What is FroshWeek?</h1>
        <p>
          FroshWeek is the ultimate introductory experience for Computing Science students at Simon
          Fraser University. Organized by the Computing Science Student Society, in partnership with
          the School of Computing Science, it is a week of fun-filled activities designed to orient,
          entertain and educate new university students with a Computing Science twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Held during the first week of the Fall semester at SFU (Sept. 3 - 6), FroshWeek is
          organized by students, for students. Incoming students receive: an in-depth introduction
          to the facilities available to them as Computing Science students; many entertaining on-
          and off-campus challenges and diversions to motivate, amuse, and connect them with other
          students; valuable advice from their elders with respect to courses and the university
          experience in general; and some free food and tools to make the transition to university
          much smoother.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginning in 2004, and now in its tenth year running, Computing Science's Froshweek has
          matured into one of the most well received and recognized student-organized events at
          Simon Fraser University. It is a memorable and cherished week for participants and
          organizers alike.
        </p>
        <h1>What is the Computing Science Student Society?</h1>
        <p>
          The Computing Science Student Society is a departmental student society based out of Simon
          Fraser University. Operating under the Simon Fraser Student Society, we act to recognize
          the academic and recreational demands of Computing Science students, providing them with a
          better experience at SFU. We have seats on the School of Computing Science Undergraduate
          Program Committee and the Faculty of Applied Science Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.
          The society also facilitates recreational activities, such as LAN parties, board game
          nights and movie nights, as well as joining the Simon Fraser Student Society and other
          departmental student societies for events. On a day-to-day level, the society provides
          services for Computing Science students such as a common area, printing, and inexpensive
          beverages.
