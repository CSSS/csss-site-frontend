          <a id="faq_1">1. What's the difference between FroshWeek and </a
          ><a href="http://www.sfu.ca/studentlife/orientation/index.html"
            >Discover SFU Orientation</a
          >?
        </p>

        <p>
          Discover SFU Orientation is a very informative 2 days in August that teaches you where
          stuff on campus is, how to be successful, and prepares you for a solid start at
          university. You will meet one upper-year student, called your Orientation Leader (OL) who
          may or may not be in Computing Science, and ~15 other students in Applied Science. It's
          useful, especially for those who don't know the campus very well.
        </p>

        <p>
          FroshWeek is just pure, unadulterated FUN, and is for all CS students, regardless of how
          well you know the campus. You will meet dozens of wise upper-year students and other first
          years in CS. You will learn things the Orientation Leaders aren't allowed to tell you.
          You'll compete for awesome prizes, and receive tons of food. You'll make memories that
          you'll look back on 20 years down the road. Awesome!
        </p>

        <p>
          FroshWeek is the easiest way to meet people, and is completely different from the 2 days
          of information you'll receive during SFU Orientation.

        <p class="question">
          <a id="faq_2"
            >2. Do I need to attend all the events in the schedule as I have classes that conflicts
            with them?</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          We know that we have lots going on during the first week and although it would be great to
          attend all of them we know it is not realistically possible. So we have marked the events
          that are essential to go to, i.e. Registration BBQ and Late Night Lunacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have any classes that conflicts with those events contact us using
          <a href="mailto:csss-frosh@sfu.ca">csss-frosh@sfu.ca</a> as early as possible and we'll
          let you know what to do.
        </p>

        <p class="question"><a id="faq_3">3. How much does FroshWeek cost?</a></p>

        <p>It's free!</p>

        <p class="question">
          <a id="faq_4"
            >4. I am a mature student or am already very familiar with campus and services offered.
            Do I still need to go?</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course! Don't think of FroshWeek as an orientation, but a chance to meet a lot of the
          people you will be studying and working with for the next few years and party it up a
          little. The point of it all, aside from meeting people, is to have fun!
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          <a id="faq_5">5. What is the best way to get more information about FroshWeek?</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          The best way to get information is checking the website periodically since we add more
          content to it as we get closer to FroshWeek. However if you have a question that hasn't
          been answered, send our <a href="mailto:csss-frosh@sfu.ca">team</a> an email and we will
          get back to you as soon as possible. If it is a general question we will post it on the
          website for everybody else as well.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          <a id="faq_6"
            >6. I am unable to make an event. Can events be missed, entered late, or left early?</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes. We understand that students may not be able to make every event. Although, we would
          prefer it if all participants were able to make these events: Registration BBQ, RAMing
          Ceremony, PacMacro and Late Night Lunacy as they are essential to the FroshWeek
          experience. If you need to leave an event early, just let a Frosh leader know what's going
          on. If you need to join an event late, please find out before hand where we will be, as
          some of our events will move around to different areas.
        </p>

        <p class="question"><a id="faq_7">7. I have a lab/tutorial during one of the events.</a></p>

        <p>
          It isn't mentioned in your schedule, but generally during the first week of classes there
          are no tutorials or labs. Make sure you still attend your lecture and be attentive,
          ensuring this is the case for your class. However, you will likely be able to attend the
          event.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          <a id="faq_8">8. I am located at the Surrey campus, can I still attend FroshWeek?</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Although some of the events are held at the Burnaby campus, FroshWeek is open to any and
          all Computing Science Students. Feel free to come join us for any of the events that you
          are able to make. Unfortunately some events will be during your classes at Surrey, other
          events are held later in the day or in downtown Vancouver. Check out the
          <a href="/2014/schedule">schedule</a> for more details on event locations and times.
