              <h2>What is Tech Fair?</h2>
              <br />
              <p>
                Long ago, when Java ran on less than 3 billion devices, Tech Fair was the CSSS's way
                of making sure our society members learned about the world beyond SFU. As time
                marched on, Tech Fair disappeared and was slowly forgotten...
                <br /><br />
                ...but, just like everything else, Tech Fair was rebooted! Since 2022, Tech Fair has
                been growing which means more booths, more students and more LinkedIn connections.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Whether you're a first year or on your last semester, Tech Fair is your opportunity
                to find out what companies are looking for. It's also-
