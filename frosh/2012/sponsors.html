        <h3>FroshWeek Founders</h3>
        <p>
          The five day long welcoming activities at Simon Fraser known as FroshWeek have been held
          annually by the CSSS for the past nine years. Without the continued support from both its
          executive board and members alike, an event as big as this could not of been successful.
          Going into its ninth year, the society is responsible for planning, organizing, hosting
          and promoting the event. Without the society's support the FroshWeek tradition could not
          be enjoyed by the generations to come.

        <h3>Hosts</h3>
        <p>
          The University graciously provides facilities and space to be used for FroshWeek events.
          Without the continued support from the University FroshWeek could not of become success it
          is today. Simon Fraser University has supported and encouraged orientation events across
          its campuses and faculties.

        <h3>Gold Level School Sponsor</h3>
        <p>
          The Faculty of Applied Sciences at SFU has always encouraged networking and
          interdisciplinary events. FroshWeek is one of our yearly opportunities to work together
          with the Engineering Science Student Society towards the same goals. The Faculty's
          contributions have made Faculty wide events such as FroshWeek successful.

        <h3>Gold Level School Sponsor</h3>
        <p>
          The School of CS have been huge supporters of the FroshWeek event. Their involvement in
          both the planning of the event, as well as providing resources and funding have been
          beneficial to the CSSS. Without the School's support over the past several years we would
          not of been able to create what is FroshWeek today.

        <h3>Gold Level School Sponsor</h3>
        <p>
          The SFSS has always advocated for increased cooperation and community among the student
          body. Knowing the value in the experiences and relationships created in those first weeks
          at Simon Fraser, the SFSS has been a huge sponsor of FroshWeek. By aiding in both the
          planning and organization of the week, as well as partially financing the event we are
          happy the FroshWeek tradition lives on through their generous contributions over the
          years.

          at SFU. With Simba's support we have been able to create the tradition that is FroshWeek,
          which could not have been done otherwise. We are proud to have Simba Technologies as a
          Gold Level sponsor once again this year.
